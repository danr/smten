Working on enoch, which is looking very nice right now.

One thing I would like to do is demonstrate the different ways you can use
enoch/seri to mix haskell and seri code. I think the share query is a great
example. The different things I can do, which I should do at some point (but
not now, because it seems more like grunt work, and it's late) are:

- share with quadruple as a haskell function
Inlines everything, smt solver can't see sharing.

- share with quadruple as a lamE
quadruple defined in haskell, but looks clunky

- share with quadruple defined in seri
and "imported" to haskell using varE. Looks great, but requires external code
be written.

- share with quadruple defined using a quasi-quoter
Looks good, no external code required, but I'm not sure how I can make sure
the types are correct. We don't have access to the environment at this point,
so I don't know what the types of variables should be.


Fine. What do I want to do now then? Nothing. I've worked too much on this
today already. I need a break.
