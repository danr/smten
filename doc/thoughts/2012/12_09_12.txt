Two things.

1. the qtuple test for dsel probably isn't working because we are getting
mixed up between "(,)" and "Tuple2". I'll double check that.

Once I settle that issue, I should merge with the master branch. I don't think
there is any fundamental loss in performance from the master branch. I think
sudoku2 is a fluke. I'm much happier with the current state of things.

2. I think I know how to solve the transform problem nicer. It's an idea I've
had before, but have been too afraid to consider. But let me consider it.

The idea is this: you build up ExpH inside an environment. This environment
conntains:
 * values of local and free variables
 * whether to use specialization and the logic to use
 * anything else I may want to know about for elaboration later

Why does this work?

The assert function can modify the environment to add specialization.
caseEH can modify the environment for inferred value propagation.

Now... this is a big change. Complicated. And not entirely clear to me yet.
For example... when we apply a function, who makes sure all the arguments have
a transformation applied to them? Perhaps whenever we modify the environment,
we have to...

Perhaps values of variables have to be themselves functions of the
environment. Something like that.

It's similar to the transformation thing, but I think a much nicer way to
think about it. I'll keep thinking about it some more.

For now, let me update the master branch.

1. Yes. The tuple problem is as I thought. I'm not sure how to fix it though.
The trouble is, I have no way to construct a ... oh. I know. Of course...
