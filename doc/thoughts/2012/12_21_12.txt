Goal: add concretization support to haskellf translation.

From the primitives I know the pattern. It shouldn't be hard at all. Just the
usual tedium whenever generating code pragmatically.

I think this should be very helpful performance wise.

Shall I just dive right in?

Here's the convention I'll use...

* get rid of __mkFoo. I can just use the actual constructors I generate.
* add a Foo__s data constructor for data type Foo.

Everything is else is straight forward...

Let me just dive in and try it out.

Okay! So I think I've completed the rough draft...

Other things to do first: replace conS with conS'.

Then get it all to compile.

Looks like it works. Cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what performance
improvement we get in shampi. I'm hoping a lot.
