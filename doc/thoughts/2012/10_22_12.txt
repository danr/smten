Looked more into the yices1 problem I'm having.

It seems _S_empty_rep_storage is used for representing the empty STL string,
and needs to be statically handled by the linker. This causes problems with
dynamic linking.

Is there some other way I can handle it?

I have to figure out how to use the -R flag in ld. Point it to some address
with no value? With a bunch of zeros?

I don't know how to make it work. Perhaps, for now, I'll just have to disable
support for yices1? Or don't do Enoch and yices1 all at once? I don't know how
to avoid that, other than getting rid of yices1.

Ack! Ug! Gar!
