Working on HAMPI in seri, some feature requests have come up:

Features desired for seri:
* explicit export list
+ implicit import of prelude
* list comprehensions
+ range things: [0..foo]
+ pattern variable binding

If I can do any of them without too much trouble, I think I should.

Let me start with the easiest if I can.

implicit import of prelude...

Always implicitly import prelude. For every module. Easy.

First I have to solve the duplicate import problem.

Okay, we have implicit import of prelude.
Next thing... pattern variable binding.

I want a new kind of pattern:

AsP Name Pat. Should be easy enough, right?

Okay, we now support as patterns.

Let me look into the range thing next.

Looks like a limited version to start is easy enough.

[x..y] desugars into: enumFromTo x y
I can start with just Integer support.

Tue Dec 11 11:38:46 EST 2012

Okay, now we have basic [x..y] support.

How about a look at list comprehensions?

List comprehensions are certainly doable... but I feel like I've done enough
sugar for now, so let me leave it as todo for another time.
