Looking into this bug with multiple Bit vector data type definitions.

It looks like the monomorphic is returning duplicate declarations of the bit#n
types and of the primitives. These duplications are not being eliminated.

Question: why is monomorphic returning duplicated declarations? Isn't that a
bug?

Is the monomorphizer doing a lot more work than it ought to be?

Is there something odd with the implementation of sets used by monomorphic?

I can hack around the issue, but I should really understand why it's behaving
different than I think it should.

It's because we do a mapM over the set, which goes from a set to a list, and
we can end up with more duplicates.

I'm just making the list of declarations a set now. That should clear that up
well enough.
