Looks like I may have found an acceptable new name for seri: Smten.

It has SMT.
It makes sense as an acronym like thing: SMT Enable, or SMT Enhancer.

So, how to fix my bug? Easy: keep a list of all the variables in context. Use
that when looking what to query of the SMT solver. A new free variable pushes
to the list, and queryS preserves the list. Easy!

Cool.
