Kind inference.

First off, there's a bug in kindOf as I've implemented it. It doesn't do what
it should.

I need to have a Kind associated with ConT. Then I can do proper kindOf. And
that will help with kind inference too.

1+ Add Kind to ConT
2+ Fix kindOf to deal with AppT properly.
3. Implement kind inference,
  Start by doing kind inference for a given Type.
  In a monad where we can look up type constructor kinds.

I'll have to continue this when I next have the opportunity.
