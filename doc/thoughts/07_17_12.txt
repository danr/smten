Bruno says he fixed the yices1 bug I was running into. I should try that out.

Continuing this morning with the update to the yices2 target. It ran into a
bug I haven't looked into yet.

After I clear that up, the plan is to change the errorize thing, and instead
rewrite the environment:

PrimD "error"  turns into ValD "error" = \_ -> ~error

Then, define update, and change
ValD "update" into PrimD "update", and handle that in the yices back end.

Now my array test should work in both yices1 and yices2.

I think it's becoming more and more an issue that we need support for
modularity. We need hiding. We need qualified names. I don't know how to
implement this, but I should figure it out and do something about it. It can't
be that hard. Just understand all the cases and what all can be done.

Lastly, before it gets too late, I would like to check into the ctsrd
repository, including a nice readme on how to get started. That so I have
something to talk about Wednesday at our weekly meeting.

Clear? Good. Let me get started.
