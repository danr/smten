We have a bug in seri. I think. I suppose it could be in Nirav's code...

Anyway, the symptoms are as follows:

Using the interpreter:
* It hangs, eating up lots of memory
* Doing control-C under profiling causes tons more memory to be used up, and
  no profile is created
    Maybe stuck in an allocation loop?
* It seems to be able to handle similar queries of the same length
* We expect very small queries
* Appears to get stuck on an assertion.
    Free variables have been declared, but no more of the query is printed.

Using the compiler:
* Generated haskell code does not compile (a seri bug!)

Clearly there is a bug in the haskell code generation. That may or may not be
related. It needs to be fixed eventually.

Okay! So first step is... try to minimize the test case as much as possible,
to isolate what the problem could be.
