So, here's what I propose for sharing pruning information.

Have a generic ExpH sharing thing.

share :: ExpH -> Unique -> a -> a
shared :: ExpH -> Unique -> Maybe a

But names conflict with existing ones, so...

inserted :: ExpH -> Unique -> a -> a
lookup

Those names conflict too.

But, anyway, whatever the names, the idea is you have a way to write and read
entries associated with each ExpH based on a Unique identifier.

So, for example, Prune will have an identifier. It can lookup in an expression
to see if pruning has been done before.

The implementation: Each ExpH_Cell should have an (IORef (Map Unique Dynamic))
associated with it which can be read and written.

Cool. Let me come back and try this when I have the chance.
