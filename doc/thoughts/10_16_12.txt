Lot's of changes in store. This is really exciting. I'll go a little bit at a
time.

First task: test the renaming of yices1 library symbols. I want to merge
seriq1 and seriq2 into a single executable and verify it works.

I can start by implementing seriq, with the added flag for --yices1 or
--yices2. Or, perhaps, --smt yices1 --smt yices2.

Get that to work. Replace seriq1 and seriq2, then remove seriq1 and seriq2.
