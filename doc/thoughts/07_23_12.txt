Numeric type proposal:

Type = ...
     | NumT Integer      -- ^ #0, #1, #2, ...
     | NumOpT NumOp Type Type -- ^ <type> <op> <type>

type NumOp = String
    "+", "-", "*", etc... Or fixed. I don't know. Whatever works best I
    suppose. If we can handle uninterpreted operators, then strings may make
    sense.

Exp = ...
      ConE Sig  -- ^ Could also be: #1, #2, ...

Primitive:
valueof :: #n -> Integer,
  where the #n notation is a primitive constraint on n to be a numeric type?
 I don't want a user visible class like Numeric, because I'd rather it be a
 builtin thing. But should we have this separate notation? Or should we use
more traditional...

valueof :: (# n) => n -> Integer

Well, if we did it the other way...

Maybe the thing to do is distinguish between VarT and NVarT. One is a type
variable, the other is a numeric type variable. They are two distinct things.

Why have them be two distinct things? So you can rule out Bit Integer, for
example? So we can verify the kinds of types we encounter?


What is enough? Let me just write down all the features in some proposal, then
think about the implementation.

- #0, #1, ... 
Syntax for type constructors and data constructors of numeric types.

- #v
A numeric type variable. Has a distinct kind from a regular type variable.

- (#m <op> #v)
Numeric type operators.
+, *, -, etc...

- valueof primitive
valueof :: #n -> Integer

- (<mt> <cop> <mt>) 
Numeric type constraint.
<, =, etc... To go in a class context.

And that's it. The entire extension for numeric types.

So, for example, now I can say things like:

concat :: Bit #n -> Bit #m -> Bit (#n+#m)
concat :: (#n + #m = #k) => Bit #n -> Bit #m -> Bit #k

data Bits #n = Bits (Vector #n Bit)

data Vector #n a = Vector #n [a]

length :: Vector #n a -> Integer
length (Vector n _) = valueof n


Hmm... so it looks like we want a NVarE too then, for a variable of numeric
type? Or maybe that doesn't matter here. Let's avoid it if we can.

I think that's seems reasonable as a first attempt. I'll have to do kind
checking, I think, but I already should be doing that and am not.

Now... what all should change in the implementation?

- kind checking. Make sure we have the right kinds of things. Only a numeric
  kind type can be used where a numeric type variable is expected. Also make
  sure types aren't over or under applied here. It might make sense to add
  kind checking first, before numeric type checking, just to have that all in
  place already.

- Add knowledge of numeric constraints to the type solver and type checker.

Let's start by thinking about the type checker.

The type checker is going to ask things like: are these two numeric types
equal. It has to check for that. We can no longer use simple structural
equality. We now need to take into account the environment. That is, the
context.

Given a context and a check for equality, figure out a way to say if the types
are equal or not. That's the main issue here. Having a separate numeric type
solver module would likely be helpful.

I think that's all we need in the type checker. How about the type solver?

I think we'd like to do reduction in the type solver too if we can... But
perhaps we can treat numeric types as opaque things. The solver maybe doesn't
need to know if two numeric types are equal. It certainly shouldn't have to
look up anything in the context I don't think. Just do a best effort.

And I think those are the only major changes. If I have a numeric type
checker, that's really the only hard part here, right?

I suspect lots of things will come up when I try to implement this. Perhaps
that's the best way to try and make things work.

What's the numeric type checker interface?

Given a context of comparison operations, and an equation for a type, it
should say either: yes the equation holds, or no it does not (or rather, no, I
can't show the equation holds). Maybe having three results: match, fail,
unknown would be better.

This all depends on the supported constraints and numeric type operators. If I
start simple, it may be relatively simple. Otherwise it might get harder.

Good. So, what do you say? Shall I dive in? I can come up with a reasonable
test case... a Vector library.

data Vector #n a = Vector #n [a]

with all the functions and their numeric type constraints. And we'll see how
things work or not.

...

You know? I'm beginning to wonder if we should have a typeclass for free.

class Free a where
    free :: Query a

We could have a deriving implementation, which does the current thing, ish.
This could actually make it much easier to realize things, because we could
restrict primitive free to integers? Err... data constructors would be hard to
deal with then though.

The reason I mention is just because when you construct a free Vector, you
really want to construct it with an assertion that the length of the list is
equal to the value of the numeric type variable.

Perhaps what we really want is a Valid class.
class AssertValid a where   
    assertvalid :: a -> Query ()

Or 

class IsValid a where
    isvalid :: a -> Bool

I suppose if I wanted, then, I could have "free" be of type:

free :: (IsValid a) => Query a

So it takes a and forces it to be valid. Of course, we could build that on top
of what we have now.

validFree :: (IsValid a) => Query a
validFree = do
    x <- free
    assert (isValid x)
    return x

Good. So don't worry about that right now.

I'll make a new branch for numeric types.

Mon Jul 23 10:04:26 EDT 2012

Question: how could I implement

replicate :: a -> Vector #n a

I don't have any way to get at the value of n.

I suppose we could have a type class?

class Replicate #n where
    replicate :: a -> Vector #n a

instance Replicate #0 where
    replicate _ = []

instance (Replicate (#n - 1)) => Replicate #n where
    replicate a = Vector #n (a : (replicate a))

Oh, there's another problem. How can we get at the constructor name to
construct the numeric value? It's not in scope.

We could provide another primitive function easily enough:

numeric :: #n

Now then, could this type check?

Oh, we'd have to do it like this:

    replicate a = cons (Vector numeric [a]) (replicate a)

Now we have all the info we need. That's good.

I have to ask... how much can we do using type classes and treating numeric
types as opaque? For example.

class Add #a #b #c where {}

append :: (Add #a #b #c) => Vector #a x -> Vector #b x -> Vector #c x

Err... I don't think that's the right way to go.
    
Hmm... I wonder...

replicate a =
  let n = numeric 
  in Vector n (Prelude.replicate (valueof n) a)

That's pretty cool. I like that trick. Things work better when numeric types
have constructors and you can use a function like numeric to create them.

Good. So I'll add that extra primitive numeric. It should be trivial to
implement in the elaborator, because we know the concrete type. Harder would
be like, implementing it in haskell. I guess just have a numeric type class in
haskell with that as well as valueof as a primitive.

Oh boy, supporting the haskell target for numeric types is going to be fun.
Perhaps a binary representation would be most appropriate. Anyway, I have
other things to worry about first.

Goal, define Vector:

data Vector #n a = Vector #n [a]

replicate :: a -> Vector #n a
nil :: Vector #0 a
cons :: a -> Vector #n a -> Vector (#n+1) a
append :: Vector #n a -> Vector #m a -> Vector #(n+m) a
concat :: Vector #n (Vector #m a) -> Vector (#n*#m) a
select :: Vector #n a -> Integer -> a
update :: Vector #n a -> Integer -> a -> Vector #n a
head :: Vector #n a -> a
tail :: Vector #n a -> Vector (#n-1) a

Question: what happens if you try to take the tail of an empty vector? I guess
we should require numeric types to be positive. That's pretty cool.

Yes, I think if I can implement this library and have it work out and catch
when we have errors, that would be very good.

I guess the most interesting one will be concat. How would I implement that?

concat :: Vector #n (Vector #m a) -> Vector (#n*#m) a
concat (Vector n (v:vs)) = append v (concat (Vector numeric vs))

The type constraints generated are...

Vector (#n*#m) a = Vector (#m + #k) a
Vector #k a = Vector (#j*#m) a

Do we have enough type information to solve this?

n*m = m+k
k = j*m

k = (n-1)*m
j = (n-1)

I can do it with some symbolic evaluation.

Cool. Who knows. We'll see what trouble we run into. I think I'm ready to get
started with this.

- start implementing Vector, 1 thing at a time.
- extend the IR as needed.

So, fairly easily driven by the vector implementation.

Mon Jul 23 10:39:34 EDT 2012

Here's a thought. If you have the numeric primitive, you don't need syntax for
constructors? Um... I suppose syntax for constructors is still nice because
they carry the information explicitly.

Mon Jul 23 10:54:10 EDT 2012

I implemented vector, assuming we had everything in place. It's not hard. It
reads reasonably well.

I'm a little annoyed at having to specify numeric and _ for all the numeric
types everywhere. The only place we make use of the numeric thing is to get
the length of the vector. I suppose that's fine.

Of course... with our given implementation, you could just ask for the length
of the list I suppose. Hmm...

I take that back. We need it for replicate. It's probably better to have it
there. Otherwise we have to resort to this undefined messiness.
 
Okay, so here are the features I want to support:

- Numeric type variables: #foo 
- Numeric type constructors: #0, #1, ...
- Numeric type data constructors: #0, #1, ...
- numeric primitive
- valueof primitive
- + operator
- * operator

I think that's all we need for now.

Mon Jul 23 11:17:24 EDT 2012

Thinking about the syntax... what if we just used '#' to introduce a numeric
type?

So, instead of  (#m * #n), I would say: #(m*n). I think that might work out
better for the syntax.

Mon Jul 23 11:57:00 EDT 2012

Hmm... Annoyance with handling numeric type data constructors. They aren't
defined in the environment. And I'd rather not have them be. So it looks like
I have to define them specially.

Instead of worrying about that for now, let me just disallow them. I can use
numeric until I need otherwise.

Mon Jul 23 12:53:06 EDT 2012

I need to implement equality of types and this isSubType check.

The thing is, both type equality and isSubType now need to make use of the
environment, right?

I don't know.

Mon Jul 23 13:00:21 EDT 2012

Here's a question. Is this well typed: (undefined :: #8)?

I suppose it ought to be.

Mon Jul 23 13:02:17 EDT 2012

I'm getting a type error:
|| checkdec: expecting type a -> Vector #n a -> Vector #(n + 1) a in expression (\(a :: a) ->
||    (\(b :: Vector #~26 a) ->
||       case ((a :: a), (b :: Vector #~26 a)) of {
||         ((x :: a), (Vector :: Vector #~26 a) (_ :: #~26) (l :: [a])) ->
||           (Vector :: #(n + 1) -> [a] -> Vector #(n + 1) a) (Seri.Lib.Prelude.numeric :: #(n + 1)) (((:) :: a -> [a] -> [a]) (x :: a) (l :: [a]));
||       })) but found type a -> Vector #~26 a -> Vector #(n + 1) a
||  in declaration Seri.Lib.Vector.vcons :: a -> Vector #n a -> Vector #(n + 1) a;

wnt: a -> Vector #n a -> Vector #(n+1) a
got: a -> Vector #~26 a -> Vector #(n+1) a

I don't understand. Why do we have the ambiguity?
It seems the issue is, the expression is more general than the signature?
Perhaps that's a problem with how I do type checking? Is that not allowed?

Perhaps I should be using isSubType instead of equality. The signature should
be a subType of the expression. But! The types should reflect the type in the
signature, and the type checker can't do that. So I think this is a problem
with the type inference engine. Why can't it tell that #~26 should be #n?

Let me trace through the solver.

I wonder if this is a bug in type inference. What does type checking know that
type inference doesn't?

Oh no, there is a bug. There must be, because I see in the solution:

~2: Vector #~26 a, and I see in the system
~2: Vector #n a

So we should be able to solve Vector #~26 a = Vector #n a
#~26 = n. let me try to see where things went wrong.

Mon Jul 23 13:29:17 EDT 2012

Okay, so there are two problems.

The first is:

#n is apparently less known than #~26, which i don't agree with.
We don't do type substitution inside numeric types.

Mon Jul 23 13:43:05 EDT 2012

Okay, fixed those. Now we have a problem with vconcat.
This is the fancy one that requires we know something about arithmetic I
think. Let's see what it looks like in the type solver.

Mon Jul 23 13:52:49 EDT 2012

We have a couple problems here I think.

First is, we have this constraint:

#(a + (b*c)) = n*m

Which we don't simplify anymore. In fact, the way we treat uninterpreted
types, we would normally just ignore this as an invalid constraint. But it is
possible for it to be satisfied.

The constraint simplifies in solution eventually to:
m + (a*m) = n*m

We need to know about math in order to solve for:
a = n-1

Let's assume we could do that reduction somehow.
Then the next issue is, we want to show our call to vappend is right:

wnt: vappend :: Vector #n a -> Vector #m a -> Vector #(n+m) a
got: vappend :: Vector #m a -> Vector #((n-1)*m) a -> Vector #(n*m) a

Two things to note here: the names for the wnt and the names for the got are
not in the same scope. It would really be nice if I did some renaming to make
that clear in the error message. I was confused for a little bit there.

The next note is: this is a complex isSubType kind of question that, if we
were really smart, we should be able to verify. Why? It comes down to the
following assignments... uh, let me rename things first to avoid confusion.

wnt: vappend :: Vector #x a -> Vector #y a -> Vector #(x+y) a
got: vappend :: Vector #m a -> Vector #((n-1)*m) a -> Vector #(n*m) a

x: m
y: ((n-1)*m)
m + ((n-1)*m) ==? n*m

So, once again, we run into a question about math. Can we show that, yes,
indeed, m + (n-1)*m = n*m?

Or, another way to ask it, can we let the user tell us that that is indeed the
case?

I haven't added the numeric type constraints for equality, lt, etc... Perhaps
we don't need those at all? I don't know.

Let me comment out this fancy case for now and come back to it in just a
little bit.

Mon Jul 23 14:04:42 EDT 2012

Good. With that commented out, all the rest seems to work okay. None of those
things require the use of math. That's actually pretty cool.

But we are running into an annoying thing: haskell does not support numeric
types. How do I compile numeric types to haskell?

I'd really rather not deal with that question just now.

The way to deal with it eventually, I suppose, is...

Well, we can define a numeric type class. Translate the syntax. Types and
constructors. Numeric, valueof, those should work fine.

The hard part will be the constraints. How do we expression m+n?
I suppose we could relax the types? Just call (m+n) k?

This is something we'll want eventually. I'd just rather not deal with it
right now.

Good. So I can define some things with numeric types. Next I'd like to try
running them. I want to show we need valueof and numeric implemented in the
elaborator, and to implement them. I can do this with a test case.

Other to do steps:

- add support for numeric types in haskell target
- add support for numeric types, specifically bit vectors, to yices.

I wonder, should I be using functions for vectors instead of lists? We can't
do much in yices with free vectors and such if they are built on top of lists.
 
Let me not worry about that yet. Let me get elaboration working first.
