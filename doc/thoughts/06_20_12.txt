I have a hypothesis as to what the bug is.

When we have an application, we split it into two constraints and solve them
directly. But that means we don't substitute the result of the first
constraint into the second.

This may not be the bug I'm seeing, but it's certainly a bug, and it has an
easy fix, so let me fix it and see what happens.

That wasn't the problem I'm seeing.

Let me go through a step at a time, see what happens and if it makes sense to
me or not. Again, going through the solution process, not the constraint
process.

Erg... Apparently there's a problem with the build system. That's bad.
Probably something to do with out the copy from build to source is done.

And thus, the bug I thought was the problem turns out to really be the problem
it would seem.
