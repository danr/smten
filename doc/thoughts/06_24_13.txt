Trouble: what to do about things like GHC.Integer.Type.Integer? Because
GHC.Integer.Type is a hidden module...

Well, I suppose this won't be a problem long term for smten, because we will
be generating Smten.Lib.GHC.Integer.Type, which I can expose.

I suppose, for the time being, I may as well make that a special case.

And everything works! That is, all the stuff not involving type classes. And
it actually runs. That's pretty cool.

The next challenge will be to get type classes to work.

I'll have to understand how they work, because currently I don't understand
how they work.
