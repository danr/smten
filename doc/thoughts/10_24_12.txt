There has been a request for type signature expressions in Seri.

 (e :: t)

Which is the same as expression (e), only with explicit type t.

It seems like we can make this into a syntactic sugar:

 (e :: t) is desugared into (AppE (VarE (Sig "id" (arrowsT [t, t]))) e)

That seems like it should work okay to me. I can replace the old
interpretation of a typed name. That may even help the parsing a bit. Or it
may lead to disaster, I don't know.

Let me try it out. And I can use it to explicitly type some integers in my
test case.

It appears to be working well enough. Cool.

Let me also check out the comments issue while I'm at it.
