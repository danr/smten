I have 30 minutes this morning to work. I'm going to make a 'seri' executable
which, for now, combines serio and seriq.

Question is... do I want to try using modes? What would the modes be?

seri type 
seri haskell
seri query
seri io

But so much of the other stuff is shared, it really seems a waste not to keep
it that way? I suppose I could define a data type with the shared data? Err...

Alternatively, I can specify the mode as a flag.

--run=Type or Haskell or Query or Io

Yes, that sounds reasonable to me.

Let me write it up then.

Okay, so I took a little more than 30 minutes, but this is good now. I have a
single seri executable which can do everything. I like it. Wonderful.

The next thing I'll want to play with is... probably a runYices1 and runYices2
IO primitives for seri so I don't need this --query option and everything can
be done in IO.

Of course, now that I have IO, I could also get rid of pure and run my tests
in IO... Just a thought.
