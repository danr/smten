Goal for today? Overall it would be modularity.

It would also be nice if I could get rid of this seg faulting bug, but I don't
know what to do about that.

I think it would be good to pull out stuff from Sugar which isn't really
sugar. It could go into Seri.Lambda.Prelude... That is, if I don't want to
move it out of Seri.Lambda.

Let me start by organizing Sugar to collect what I think should be in Sugar,
and what I would want to put in, say, Seri.Lambda.Prelude.

Running into the seg fault again. Is there, please, some way I can figure out
what the problem is and fix it?

Ideas?

So what we observe is... somehow something is getting a null pointer in the GC
environment which isn't expected. How could it get a null pointer?

Someone outside of GC changed it? Perhaps... yices2 changed it?

One idea: try it with a different version of the compiler, see if it runs into
the same problem. For example, 6. something?

It's worth a try I suppose.
