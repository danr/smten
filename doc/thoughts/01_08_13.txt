I tried adding list comprehensions. The logic is easy enough. I just run into
problems with the parser.

The trouble is, it can't distinguish between patterns and expressions. Just
think, a list comprehension:

[ e | (a, b) ...]

Is (a, b) a pattern matching a tuple, or is it a tuple expression?

I wonder if, for now, I can just disallow a standalone expression. That's the
way I use list comprehensions anyway. Let me try that.

Well, that works. So I can at least have that support.

How should I make this work in general? The trouble is, we can't tell the
difference between a pattern and an expression, possibly until it's too
late...

One approach would be to allow an intermediate structure which can represent
an exp and a pat simultaneously. Then coerce it one way or the other. That's a
little unpleasant.
