Okay! So, first step is done. Now exp has type PatOrExp.

And the great news is, I didn't change any of the production rules, so there's
no way we could have introduced errors or conflicts. That's good.

Step 2: add As patterns to PatOrExp. Shouldn't be too hard now, should it?

Okay... good. That works fine.

Next step:

Everywhere I use 'pat', switch to 'exp' instead.

Note, after this works, I'll probably want to rename things, because it's
confusing otherwise.

Okay! Patterns work now, using PatOrExp. Nifty.

So I should be one step away from achieving my ultimate goal. And it's not too
messy, which I like. At least, I don't think it's too messy anyway.

It works! nifty!

Okay, so, last thing I need to do before I can check this into the master
branch is to rename exp and such things as poe, and add a comment saying what
is going on.

Done! It works. Wonderful. This should help with a bunch of things, including
patterns in lambdas and pattern guards.

And, as a bonus, we share all the production rules between pat and exp, so the
grammar is cleaner too.
