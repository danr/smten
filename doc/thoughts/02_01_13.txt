Here's how stand-alone deriving should work.

1. derive should take the record-type constructors as input.
This is needed for Show.

I don't think it needs the name or variables as input.

2. Module will contain a list of deriving instances, and a list of record-type
data declarations.

3. flatten1 will look up in the list of record-type data declarations from all
modules to find the record-type constructors, and it will call derive, then
append those instances to the module declarations just before qualification.

And that's it. Easy.

So... I can get to work if I really feel like I need this feature.
