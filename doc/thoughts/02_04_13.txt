I have officially received the request for stand-alone deriving as an
important feature for seri and the work Nirav wants to do. So let me implement
that.

I already worked out the plan. All I need to do is implement it.

1. Change derive to take record type constructors.
2. collect stand-alone deriving and data type definitions in modules.
3. flatten1 should look up in modules to do all stand-alone derivings.

Easy. Right? We'll see.

First step was easy. Now for the next step...

Let me start with just collection of the data type definitions.

2a is done. Now to add stand-alone deriving clauses...

That's it! Easy. Cool.

It's a bit messy, which I don't like... but what can you do?
