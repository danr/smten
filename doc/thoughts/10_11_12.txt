I'm working on making things more generic. So, the Yices context, Yices
syntax, Yices target, and Yices query are all being made generic.

I've done the context and the syntax. Though the syntax hasn't been cleanly
done yet and will need some work.

The next step is the yices target.

Ones question which comes up is this function: yicesN. Translating a user type
into a type suitable for the back end. This seems like a very yices specific
thing to me. It also seems like it is a syntax kind of thing? Or a Solver kind
of thing?

In other words, the SMT target wants to pick whatever names it wants, and it's
taking as input whatever names it gets from previous people. It's not until we
go to talk to yices directly, or STP, or whatever back end that we need to
change these names to be appropriate identifiers.

So let me move this to Concrete, and probably to the FFI interface too,
otherwise crazy stuff could happen.

In fact, I almost feel like I could reuse Name for the SMT syntax.

um. One step at a time I suppose.

I removed yicesname, and it seems to work fine still. Interesting... Let me
leave it like that until I run into trouble.
