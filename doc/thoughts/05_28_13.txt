I added enough SCCs to figure out the problem:

We are spending a ton of time in comparisons:
10% in __lexorder
 9% in string compare
 6% in integer compare
 6% in tuple2 compare
31% Total.

I bet I can improve that a lot by better user code for comparisons. I just
need to figure out what the best code to use is.

I'll do that... after my poster is done.
