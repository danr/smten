Myron brought up an interesting point. If I define the Array entirely within
the language, then it may be hard to recognize when I go to compile to yices
if it's already been inlined and simplified a bunch.

Ideally I can do it in the language and everything works fine, and the
interface is what I want at least. So let me getting it working in the
language, try it in an SMT query, and see what happens?
