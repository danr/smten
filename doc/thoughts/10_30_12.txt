I wanted to move all the .sri files into their own directory. I feel like
that's a cleaner way to do things.

There is some trouble though. For cabal to see these, they need to be under
the src directory, right? I suppose that's no so bad.

Okay, I'll move them there.

Okay, fine. I suppose I'll work on slowly cleaning this up. The trouble is, it
doesn't really feel like much in the way of forward progress to me. Just
moving things around.

Perhaps I should put more focus on STP. Because the real things I want to
figure out are:

* How to express which theories a Query requires.
* Supporting free functions in a meaningful way
* Support for STP and Z3 and a SAT solver of some sort

That would get the language to a point where I use it the way I envision it
should be used.

Other things are things like:

* case analysis to disallow error
* handle errors properly
* static analysis to detect non-concrete queries or leaky queries

I don't know.

I'd rather not be cleaning things up forever... I need to mix in some real
progress. Unfortunately, I don't feel like the static analysis and bug stuff
is real progress, because I can just write rational queries manually for now.

So, really, if I have free time, I ought to work on... STP.

Or, you know what? If it's easier, why not try to plug in a SAT solver? I'm
not so sure it will be easier. Okay, so try STP seriously first. Then, if I
run into problems, move onto a SAT solver to see if it is any easier.

That should be the leading priority right now. With cleanup operations as we
go on the side.
