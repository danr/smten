I'm taking time now to work on kind inference, because I've been doing too
much work for the class (and not enough at the same time).

First task: dependency sort.

Goal is: given an environment/list of declarations, to sort them into a list
of declarations groups.

Problem: I don't have the energy to work on this right now. :(
