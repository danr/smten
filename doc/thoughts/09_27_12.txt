Looks like we are facing a delambdafication bug which I wasn't seeing before
for whatever reason.

The example is clear:

(case free1 of
  ... -> f
  ... -> g) x

And I want to rewrite this as:

case free1 of
  ... -> f x
  ... -> g x

Actually, what we really would like to do is share x. Do something like:

let x' = x
in case free1 of
      ... -> f x'
      ... -> g x'

But let me not worry about that right now. Let me fix the bug first.

As I said when I got rid of delambdafication, let me put this in the
elaborator. If I want to, I can make a flag. Otherwise I can just always do it
as an elaboration step.

Now, how does this look in the elaborator?

(LaceE
   ... -> f
   ... -> g
) free1 x

So, look for a Lace which is applied to too many arguments which doesn't match
anything. Take the tail arguments which are too many, and apply those inside
each match.
