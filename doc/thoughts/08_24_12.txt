Aha! So, good progress yesterday. One more thing to try today: have a hash map
for primitives. That will be cool.

Also, try Sudoku with sharing. I think the varuse thing may work around that
particular bug, which would be neat.

Plan:
1. Add support for bit vectors in HOAS elaborator
2. Use a hash table for primitives in HOAS elaborator
3. Try out the Sudoku's see if they all work
4. Remove old elaborators entirely
5. Clean up Fresh. We just need the 2: Fast and Pretty.

At this point, I'll call seri stable for the purposes of todays presentation.
I need to work fast.

Gather more numbers:
- Sudokus, BCL3: yices1 vs yices2 vs seriq vs seriq2

Update and review presentation.


Lots to do today, let me get going.

First step: bit vector primitives.

Actually... I could probably switch to a hash table first, since I have the
todos in place. Yes. Let me try that.

I tried the hash table. I'm not convinced it's any faster. But I'll leave it
in, because it is cleaner, and should support better the addition of lots more
primitives.
