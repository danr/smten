Aha! So, good progress yesterday. One more thing to try today: have a hash map
for primitives. That will be cool.

Also, try Sudoku with sharing. I think the varuse thing may work around that
particular bug, which would be neat.

Plan:
1. Add support for bit vectors in HOAS elaborator
2. Use a hash table for primitives in HOAS elaborator
3. Try out the Sudoku's see if they all work
4. Remove old elaborators entirely
5. Clean up Fresh. We just need the 2: Fast and Pretty.

At this point, I'll call seri stable for the purposes of todays presentation.
I need to work fast.

Gather more numbers:
- Sudokus, BCL3: yices1 vs yices2 vs seriq vs seriq2

Update and review presentation.


Lots to do today, let me get going.

First step: bit vector primitives.

Actually... I could probably switch to a hash table first, since I have the
todos in place. Yes. Let me try that.

I tried the hash table. I'm not convinced it's any faster. But I'll leave it
in, because it is cleaner, and should support better the addition of lots more
primitives.

Let me try out sudoku.

Nope. Doesn't work. Sadness. It actually looks even worse. There are a couple
things not being inlined now that I would have expected.

Oh well. It was worth a hope.

Back to the original plan: support for bitvector primitives.

Let me be guided by my tests.

There! Bit vectors are implemented.
