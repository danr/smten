Goal for today?

First step: support record type constructors. It's not hard, and it's useful.
Have a DataDRec type, build that up, then be able to convert DataDRec to
[Dec].

I think, look into Myron's example query. The library, at least, is going to
be the same as he has now. Try to understand what features and tests I should
do to make it reasonable to express the library (appropriately) in seri.
Perhaps adding support for Vectors and numeric types?

Remember the primary next goal: get Myron to use seri.


Okay, let's start with record type constructors. I claim this isn't hard,
so... let's try it out and see.
