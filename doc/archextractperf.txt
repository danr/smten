There is a performance bug in arch-extract. This documents my path towards
discovery of the bug.

Problem:
 * On master branch, genrulerels in arch-extract simpilfied_four_stage
   takes a few seconds
 * On reimpl branch, genrulerels in arch-extract blows up, taking tons of
   memory

Looking at specific rule combinations:
  isCF fetch decode:    blows up, all time is in ite0, iteF, andFF, orFF

This behavior appears to show up for all the fetch vs XXX rules.
As well as other combinations.

Question: which ite0 are we talking about?
Hypothesis: ite0 for Bit n.
Experiment: add a cost center for Bit n ite0, see if it shows up on profile.
Result:
  30% ite_BitF, 60% iteF

Question: does a simpler test case have the same problem?
For example: example1 and example2?
Result: Both example1 and example2 work fine.

Question: Can I minimize the problem?

Simplification which demonstrates problem:
  assert (applys [r] s /= applys [r] s)
    for any real rule.
Goal: simplify the rule 'r' as much as possible.

Results:
* Simplest rule which blows up: enqueue a constant value to a FIFO1

The essences of the case which blows up seems to be:
  s1 = if p s then s else s { a = 0 }
  s2 = if p s then s else s { a = 0 }
  assert (s /= s)

With p s some predicate on the state.

We should be able to replicate this outside the context of arch-extract.
Some things which may matter:
 * how is the Eq operator implemented? Ideally we use auto-derived Eq
 * how many fields does the state 's' have?

Let me try to replicate this problem apart from arch-extract.

I was unable to replicate the problem outside, but I have made progress with
minimization:
 * The problem in Eq is due to comparison of the core memory, not the processor.

Hypothesis for minimal test case:
 For symbolic predicate p, assert (if p then s else id s 
                                /= if p then s else id s)

Yup! That's it. And it looks like we do need both 'id' terms.
Now... why does this blow up?

Note: it blows up if I use == too.
Note: simpler is to take 's' to be 'Array'.

This is quite amazing, because the Array is very very small.
It has 2 elements only. There must be some other issue.
It doesn't matter what the element type is.
If I make indices for s1 [0, 1] instead of (indices s1), then it no longer
blows up. Same with s2.

If I change index type to Int, then it no longer blows up.

So, there is something wrong with ite for the Bit type, such that:
  ite0 p 0 0        does not go to 0?
  ite0 p 1 1        does not go to 1?
But... no. It is somehow caught up in the context of the array.

Anyway, the test case now is simple enough that I should be able to step
through the code to understand what's going on.

Even simpler: The comparison of just the indices for s1 and s2 blow up. We
don't have to access any elements.

Perhaps, then, the elements don't matter at all?
 
Even simpler:

type T = Bit 2

main :: IO ()
main = do
  r <- run_symbolic stp $ do
         p <- free_Bool
         let s = (0 :: T, 1 :: T)
             s1 = if p then s else id s
             s2 = if p then s else id s
         assert (range s1 == range s2)
  putStrLn (show r)

Let's experiment with the data types.

Bit 2: blows up
Integer: blows up
Int: works fine

I suspect a problem with the implementation of PartialF, and something to do
with the implementations of 'range'.

Here's what appears to be happening:

For some reason, the condition (l > h) is symbolic, which means we can't
determine which branch to take, so we take both, and one of them is infinite.

The problem: (l > h) should be concrete, not symbolic.

Now we should be ready to step through things...

But, let me try just a little more to see if I can simplify.
Yes, I can. Good. We need not involve any tuples.

Let me step through now and understand what's going on.

p = BoolF (VarFF 1) FalseFF _|_
s = IntegerF (PartialF TrueFF (IntegerFF 1) _|_)
s1 = IntegerF (PartialF TrueFF (IIteFF (VarFF 1) (IntFF 1) (IntFF 1)) _|_)
s2 = IntegerF (PartialF TrueFF (IIteFF (VarFF 1) (IntFF 1) (IntFF 1)) _|_)

3 = integerF (PartialF TrueFF (IntegerFF 3) _|_)

let q1 = (s1 <= 3):
 = binarypF ileqFF (PartialF TrueFF (IIteFF (VarFF 1) (IntFF 1) (IntFF 1)) _|_)
                   (PartialF TrueFF (IntegerFF 3) _|_)
 = BoolF (ILeqFF (IIteFF (VarFF 1) (IntFF 1) (IntFF 1)) (IntegerFF 3)) FalseFF _|_

Now, to use 'q1', and its friend 'q2' in constructing our lists l1 and l2.
And updating the test case to  be less silly:

q1 = BoolF (ILeqFF (IIteFF (VarFF 1) (IntFF 0) (IntFF 1)) (IntegerFF 3)) FalseFF _|_
q2 = BoolF (ILeqFF (IIteFF (VarFF 2) (IntFF 2) (IntFF 3)) (IntegerFF 3)) FalseFF _|_

l1 = ite q1 Nil (0 `Cons` range (s1+1))
   = List {
       gdNil__ = ite0 q1 True False,
       gdCons__ = ite0 q1 False True,
       flCons__1 = ite0 q1 _|_ 0,
       flCons__2 = ite0 q1 _|_ (range (s1+1))
     }

ite0 q1 True False,
   = iteF_ (ILeqFF (IIteFF (VarFF 1) (IntFF 1) (IntFF 1)) (IntegerFF 3)) trueF falseF
   = BoolF q1p FalseFF _|_

l1 = List {
       gdNil__ = BoolF q1p FalseFF _|_
       gdCons__ = BoolF (NotFF q1p) FalseFF _|_
       flCons__1 = IntegerF (PartialF (not q1p) (IIteFF q1p (IntFF 0) (IntFF 0) _|_)
       flCons__2 = ite0 q1 _|_ (range (s1+1))
     }

ite0 q1 _|_ (range (s1+1)) = l1' =
  List {
    gdNil__ = ite0 q1 _|_ (BoolF q1p' FalseFF _|_),
    gdCons__ = BoolF (NotFF q1p) _|_ (BoolF (NotFF q1p') FalseFF _|_),
    flCons__1 = ...
    flCons__2 = ...
  }

l1 = List {
       gdNil__ = BoolF q1p FalseFF _|_
       gdCons__ = BoolF (NotFF q1p) FalseFF _|_
       flCons__1 = IntegerF (PartialF (not q1p) (IIteFF q1p (IntFF 0) (IntFF 0)) _|_)
       flCons__2 = l1'
     }

Now, try l1 == l2.
After some simplifications:
  
  ite (BoolF q1p FalseFF _|_)
      (ite (BoolF q2p FalseFF _|_) True False)
      (ite (BoolF q2p FalseFF _|_) False (
          ite ((==) (IntegerF (PartialF (not q1p) (IIteFF q1p (IntFF 0) (IntFF 0)) _|_))
                    (IntegerF (PartialF (not q2p) (IIteFF q2p (IntFF 0) (IntFF 0)) _|_)))
              ((==) l1' l2')
              False))
  

You know what this looks like? It looks like an infinitely large finite
formula. And it just grows and grows and grows. I think that's the problem. I
don't have a cutoff to stop the growth.

And given that... I can probably make another test case which quite simply
demonstrates the problem.

Part of what's sad about this test case is, we know some of the branches are
unreachable. If only we asked the SMT solver sooner, it could have told us.

Unfortunately, it looks to me like this is a fundamental flaw in the design,
not just a bug in the implementation. Well... technically I always knew this
could happen, I was just assuming it wouldn't come up in normal programs.

Yes. The following program replicates the issue:

foo :: Integer -> Bool
foo x = if x <= 3 then True else (x <= 5 && foo (x+1))

main :: IO ()
main = do
  r <- run_symbolic yices2 $ do
         x <- mplus (return 0) (return 1)
         assert (foo x)
  putStrLn (show r)

Some thoughts on solutions:
 1. Optimize ite p x y ===> x
     when x and y are concrete and equal. For both Bit and Integer.
    Note, we don't want to do it in general, because we did that before and
    the cost to check for equality is enormous in some cases. But this shallow
    optimization should be reasonable, and should fix all the important cases,
    where you go from can't do anything to can do stuff very well. The other
    cases would just be can't do anything to can't do a little less than
    anything.

 2. Ideally we can keep track of how big a finite formula is, and if it is too
    big, split it up into a reasonable sized part and a 'future' part.
    The best thing to do for size if we could would be space on the heap,
    because that's what actually matters. I fear it will be hard to figure
    that out though, because we have to keep track of pointers. Maybe keep a
    set of stable names with each item, and wait until that set contains too
    many elements?

    Approximations we could do are: count the number of nodes. Shared nodes
    will be double counted, which is really bad (we could be off by an
    exponential amount of space).

    Another: count the depth of expression. Again, we could be off by an
    exponential amount of space.

Doing (1) fixed the specific case for arch-extract that I had reduced to, but
did not solve the overall arch-extract problem. This is slightly unexpected,
because we shouldn't need an infinite formula given that the master branch
works just fine on arch-extract. I'll have to start over again to try and
minimize the problem.
