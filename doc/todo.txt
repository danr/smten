- Allow arbitrary patterns in lambda expression arguments.
    example: \(Foo x) -> x+1

- Add support for list sequences
    example: [1..5]

- Add support for let expressions (?)
    example: let foo = 2 in foo + 40
    Translates to: case 2 of { foo -> foo + 40; }
    Note: pattern matches in let should not be allowed, because we can't do
          them lazily with this transformation. And recursive let blocks are
          not allowed.

- multi-clause instance methods probably don't work

- infix list constructor for patterns and expressions

- add layout support
