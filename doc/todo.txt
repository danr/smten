- Allow arbitrary patterns in lambda expression arguments.
    example: \(Foo x) -> x+1

- Add support for list sequences
    example: [1..5]

- Add support for let expressions
    example: let foo = 2 in foo + 40
    idea: is let the same thing as abstraction + application?
          could we just rewrite this as: (\foo -> foo + 40) 2
          would we want to?
