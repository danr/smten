Priority::
* Add yices2 solver (verifying we can actually use an SMT solver)

* Add SMT Datatype test
* Add SMT Error test

* Add support for symbolic Integers: Add SMT Integer test
* Add SMT Share test

* Add support for concrete Bit Vectors
* Add support for symbolic Bit Vectors: Add SMT Bit test
* Add SMT Sudoku test

* Add yices1 solver
* Add stp solver

* Port shampi to ghc-plugin
* Port arch-extract to ghc-plugin

Cleanup::
* Cleanup primitive Char
* Cleanup primitive Integer
* Support symbolic Int
* Support symbolic IO

Future Work::
* Add minisat as a solver (requires CNF)
* Add Z3 as a solver

Front End::
* Auto-derive Show, Eq, Ord, Ix

Documentation
* Update user guide

Runtime::
* detect potential non-termination and perform appropriate abstraction and
  refinement.

Known Bugs::
* Error non-termination tests (in Error)
* Sharing of appeval (in Share)
* STP bug (in Nest)
* STP bug (in Bit)
* STP bv_and bug (in Bit)
* Yices1 left shift (in Bit)

Suspected Bugs::
* Test newtype
* Memory leaks of solvers
            
Other::
* TODO's inlined in the code
* Do a code review of all of Smten, figure out what can be cleaned up and how.
