Priority::
* Add support for symbolic Bit Vectors: Add SMT Bit test
* Add SMT Sudoku test

* Add stp solver

* Port shampi to ghc-plugin
* Port arch-extract to ghc-plugin
* Add SMT Error test (if needed)
* Add SMT Share test (if needed)

Cleanup::
* Support symbolic IO
* Figure out a way so that Bool and Integer and Bit definitions are not so
  tied up with each other?

Future Work::
* Add minisat as a solver (requires CNF)
* Add Z3 as a solver

Front End::
* Auto-derive Show, Eq, Ord, Ix
  maybe look into possibility of using Eq, Ord, etc... from ghc for this

Documentation
* Update user guide

Runtime::
* detect potential non-termination and perform appropriate abstraction and
  refinement.

Known Bugs::
* Error non-termination tests (in Error)
* Sharing of appeval (in Share)
* STP bug (in Nest)
* STP bug (in Bit)
* STP bv_and bug (in Bit)
* Yices1 left shift (in Bit)
* newtype doesn't work: the generated code doesn't typecheck.

Suspected Bugs::
* Memory leaks of solvers
            
Other::
* TODO's inlined in the code
* Do a code review of all of Smten, figure out what can be cleaned up and how.
