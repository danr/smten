I want to give seri another shot, for the fun of it. But also as something
potentially useful. It's strange how I keep going around in full circles, and
I did a full circle away from seri and now back again.

But let me see if I can't make it rather cleaner this time around.

What's the goal?

We want the following:

- An intermediate representation for describing seri programs.
This will consist of expressions, types, perhaps modules.
My vision is to have an IR which is described in such a way that you can pick
and choose just the pieces you want to use, and it's extensible, so you can
add in things for where you want to use it. So it's not specific to my
language, but should, for example, work for a lambda calculus that Nirav wants
for SMT, work for BCL, for Structural Spec, and all seri all at once, but in a
clean way.

- C code generation of IR.
To separate things out, have a C IR for describing a C program in haskell. Or
C++ or both or something like that. Then have conversion from the seri IR to
that C ir, and have that C ir support pretty printing.

- BSV code generation of IR.
Analogous to the C code generation: we have a BSV IR we can translate to, then
pretty print to get working bluespec.

- Haskell code generation of IR.
Just convert to haskell's existing IR, and pretty print that.

- Haskell Interpreter for IR.
Aka: Static elaborator of IR.

- Clean front end.
This could be hard. What I want is this: I want to be able to describe
programs in haskell, using the full generality and abstractions haskell
provides. I want to generate from them a monomorphic, simple seri IR.

This might involve having a parser, or some translation to/from template
haskell. Important things: we want to leverage the abstractions of haskell. We
want to pass meaningful names into the IR from the front end. We want to have
types checked properly. It should not be messy yucky to write.


I think, perhaps, the first step would be to come up with a simple lambda IR.
Have booleans and integers and tuples, or whatever seri has.

Start writing the C or C++ and BSV IRs (which are completely separate modules
which can be reused elsewhere, which is really nice).

Once I have that baseline, then play with it to try and find good ways of
making the IR extensible and making the front end nice the way I really want
it to be.

Cool. This sounds like fun. Let me get started after breakfast.

First step: define my base language. My simple ir.

Types:
  Unit, Integer, Bool, Tuple, Function

Expressions:
  Unit, Integer, Boolean, Tuple,
  Add, Mul, Sub, Eq, Lt, If, Fst, Snd
  App, Lam, Fix

I'm not sure I like using Fix for recursive functions, but I can fix that
later. This will be enough of a start for factorial.

Okay, so I've defined my language.

The next thing to do is write a simple program in it.

Let's not start with a recursive program just yet.
In fact, let me get rid of Fix, because I don't want to start with a recursive
program.

First expression...

(\x = x*x + 3*x + 2) 5

Nifty! It works.
