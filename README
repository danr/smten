Configuring Smten for Development Build
---------------------------------------
Before building smten using the makefile, you must configure the build for your
system. This is done by creating the file "tclmk/local.tcl" containing
information about your system.

The following variables should be set in tclmk/local.tcl:
::HAPPY - The path to the happy executable for building the parser.
::env(PATH) - The PATH to use for executables
::env(LD_LIBRARY_PATH) - the ld library path

For example, tclmk/local.tcl might look like:

=========================================
set ::HAPPY /home/ruhler/.cabal/bin/happy
set ::env(PATH) "/bin:/usr/bin:/home/ruhler/local/bin"
set ::env(LD_LIBRARY_PATH) "/home/ruhler/local/lib"
=========================================

Yices1, Yices2, and STP
-----------------------
Smten currently requires yices1, yices2, and STP to be installed. See 
smten/share/doc/userguide.txt for special instructions on how to install the
yices solvers.

Building Smten
--------------
Once smten is configured for build and the required SMT solvers are installed,
it can be built by running `make`.

The makefile installs the cabal packages for smten in a pretend home
directory, compiles some programs against the installed packages, then runs
some tests on the generated executables. During the process of installation,
required packages will automatically be installed as well.

Using Smten
-----------
Consult the user guide in smten/share/doc/ for information on how to use
Smten.
