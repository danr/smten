Configuring Smten for Development Build
---------------------------------------
Before building smten using the makefile, you must configure the build for your
system. This is done by creating the file "tclmk/local.tcl" containing
information about your system.

The following variables should be set in tclmk/local.tcl:
::env(PATH) - The PATH to use for executables
::env(LD_LIBRARY_PATH) - the ld library path
::GHC - the path the the ghc executable to use

For example, tclmk/local.tcl might look like:

=========================================
set ::env(PATH) "/bin:/usr/bin:/home/ruhler/local/bin"
set ::env(LD_LIBRARY_PATH) "/home/ruhler/local/lib"
set ::GHC "/home/ruhler/local/bin/ghc"
=========================================

Yices1, Yices2, STP and Z3
--------------------------
Smten currently requires yices1, yices2, STP, and Z3 to be installed. See 
the documentation in smten-yices1, smten-yices2, smten-z3, and smten-stp
packages for more special instructions on how to install them.

Building Smten
--------------
Once smten is configured for build and the required SMT solvers are installed,
it can be built by running `make`. The following targets are supported:

all::
  Build all the smten packages locally and run the test suites for them.

userinstall::
  Build all the smten packages locally, run the test suites, and
  then install the packages into the current users account.

userinstall2::
  Install the packages into the current users account without first building
  them locally. This requires you have already built the packages locally.

clean::
  Clean up the locally generated cabal packages.

fullclean::
  Remove the entire local 'home' directory, including any packages already
  installed locally which smten depends on.

Documentation
-------------
The 'doc' directory contains mostly out of date documents. The only relevant
documents now are:

doc/todo.txt:: contains a brief list of known issues and plan work to do.
doc/history.txt:: contains the release history of smten.

For other documentation, consult the generated haddock documentation after
building the packages locally at build/home/.cabal/share/doc/index.html or 
build/smten-*/dist/doc/html/smten-*/index.html for the individual packages.
