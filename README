Configuring Smten for Development Build
---------------------------------------
Before building smten using the makefile, you must configure the build for your
system. This is done by creating the file "tclmk/local.tcl" containing
information about your system.

The following variables should be set in tclmk/local.tcl:
::env(PATH) - The PATH to use for executables
::env(LD_LIBRARY_PATH) - the ld library path
::GHC - the path the the ghc executable to use

For example, tclmk/local.tcl might look like:

=========================================
set ::env(PATH) "/bin:/usr/bin:/home/ruhler/local/bin"
set ::env(LD_LIBRARY_PATH) "/home/ruhler/local/lib"
set ::GHC "/home/ruhler/local/bin/ghc"
=========================================

Yices1, Yices2, and STP
-----------------------
Smten currently requires yices1, yices2, STP, and Z3 to be installed. See 
the documentation in smten-yices1, smten-yices2, smten-z3, and smten-stp
packages for more special instructions on how to install them.

Building Smten
--------------
Once smten is configured for build and the required SMT solvers are installed,
it can be built by running `make`.
