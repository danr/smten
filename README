Configuring Seri for Build
--------------------------
Before building seri using the makefile, you must configure the build for your
system. This is done by creating the file "tclmk/local.tcl" containing
information about your system.

The following variables should be set in tclmk/local.tcl:
::HAPPY - The path to the happy executable for building the parser.
::GHC - The path to ghc
::PACKAGE_DB - The ghc package database to use when building the seri cabal package
::env(PATH) - The PATH to use for executables
::env(GHC_PACKAGE_PATH) - your ghc package path
::env(LD_LIBRARY_PATH) - the ld library path

For example, tclmk/local.tcl might look like:

=========================================
set ::HAPPY /home/ruhler/.cabal/bin/happy
set ::GHC /usr/bin/ghc
set ::PACKAGE_DB "/var/lib/ghc/package.conf.d"
set ::env(PATH) "/bin:/usr/bin:/home/ruhler/local/bin"
set ::env(GHC_PACKAGE_PATH) "$::PACKAGE_DB:/home/ruhler/.ghc/x86_64-linux-7.4.1/package.conf.d"
set ::env(LD_LIBRARY_PATH) "/home/ruhler/local/lib"
=========================================

Yices 1 and Yices 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Seri requires both yices1 and yices2 be installed on the system. It looks
for a yices1 library called "yices" and a yices2 library called "yices2".
Because the yices 2 library is shipped as "yices", you will need to rename it
or provide a link to it called "yices2".

I also had trouble building the cabal package if the yices2 library appeared
as a shared object.  So, for example, if you have libyices.so.2.0.2 installed,
to create a "yices2" library suitable for use with seri, run the commands:

   ln -s libyices.so.2.0.2 libyices2.a 
   ln -s libyices.so.2.0.2 libyices.so.2.0 


Building Seri
-------------
Once seri is configured for build, it can be built by running `make`.

The makefile generates a cabal package for seri, builds it, then runs some
tests on the generated executables.

Generated files of note:
build/src/dist/doc/html/seri/index.html
  - the generated haddoc documentation.
build/src/dist/doc/html/seri/<exe>/Main.html
  - documentation of the given executable
build/src/dist/build/<exe>/<exe>
  - the generated executable <exe>


Trying Seri
-----------
After building seri you can try it out. For example, to run a simple query
with yices 2:

    ./build/src/dist/build/seriq2/seriq2 -d Query1.dbg -i src -m Seri.SMT.Tests.Query1.main src/Seri/SMT/Tests/Query1.sri

If it works, you should get the output:
    (Satisfiable :: Answer Integer) 5

And Query1.dbg will contain the yices2 query evaluated to get this result.

Additional sample queries are available in the src/Seri/SMT/Tests/ directory.
