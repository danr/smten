  seri-0.3.0.0
  seri-smt-0.2.0.0
 
  Changes from seri-0.2.0.0, seri-smt-0.1.0.0:
  * Added support for hex literals
  * Changed bit-vector right and left shift to take the shift amount as a
    bit vector instead of an integer
  * Cleaned up seri smt test cases

  seri-0.2.0.0
  seri-smt-0.1.0.0

  Changes from seri-0.1.1.1:
  * Split seri package into seri and seri-smt
    This is to get around issues with dynamically loading the static yices1
    and stp libraries when using template haskell.
  * Ship .sri library with the packages, and expose the install directory with
    the function Seri.seridir
  * Reorganized layout of .sri files to better match Haskell layout
    In particular, Seri.lib.Prelude is now just Prelude.
  * Add support for the STP solver.
  * Implemented runYices1, runYices2, and runSTP Seri IO primitives for
    running queries
  * Added Show class to Seri Prelude (does not yet support deriving)
  * Added support for layout in seri code.
  * Allow implicit Main module in seri code.

  Changes from seri-0.1.0.0:
  * Add support for comments with more than 2 dashes
  * Add support for generic type signature expressions
  * Add git revision info to seri.cabal file
  * Implemented loadenvth to load seri environment at compile time

  Initial release of Seri package. Yices1 support is disabled, as it doesn't
  get along well with Enoch yet.
