Introduction
------------
This tutorial demonstrates how to write a and run a "hello, world" program in
Smten.

Hello World
-----------
The following code gives an implementation of the classic "hello, world"
program in Smten:

    module HelloWorld where

    main :: IO ()
    main = putStrLn "hello, world"

The syntax and features of Smten are (mostly) the same as the Haskell
language. For a better understanding of what these lines of code mean, consult
a Haskell tutorial.

To run this program, first create a file called HelloWorld.smtn which contains
this code. Smten programs must have the extension .smtn, and the filename
should match the module name.

Then run the command:
    
    smten --io --main-is HelloWorld.main -f HelloWorld.smtn

The +smten+ command is used for interpreting or compiling smten programs. In
this case, the +--io+ flag says to interpret the given smten program. You
should see on the output the string "hello, world".
