Goals
-----
The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to install and run the 'smten'
compiler on a hello world program.

Introduction
------------
Smten is a unified language for functional programming and orchestration of
SMT queries. The Smten front-end language is Haskell. For questions on Smten
syntax, please consult a Haskell reference, such as the Haskell Report.

The implementation of Smten is based on and requires the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler (GHC), version 7.6, which can be downloaded from
http://www.haskell.org/ghc. It also requires cabal. If you haven't already
done so, you should install GHC now.

Note: Version smten-4.0.0.0 requires you have profiling libraries installed.
If you have not already done so, set 'library-profiling: True' in your
.cabal/config file.

Installing Smten
----------------
The smten compiler and runtime libraries are distributed as a set of three
cabal packages. The +smten+ package provides the compiler. The +smten-base+
package provides the Smten prelude, and +smten-lib+ provides additional Smten
libraries.

The smten cabal packages can be downloaded from github
https://github.com/ruhler/smten/releases. At the time of writing, the latest
release is smten-4.0.0.0. For this tutorial you only need the three packages
+smten+, +smten-base+, and +smten-lib+.

Install the packages using +cabal+. For example:
  
  $ tar xf smten-4.0.0.0.tar.gz
  $ cd smten-4.0.0.0
  smten-4.0.0.0$ cabal install
   ... (this may take a while ) ...
  smten-4.0.0.0$ cd ../
  $ tar xf smten-base-4.0.0.0.tar.gz
  $ cd smten-base-4.0.0.0
  smten-base-4.0.0.0$ cabal install
   ... (this may take a while ) ...
  smten-base-4.0.0.0$ cd ../
  $ tar xf smten-lib-4.0.0.0.tar.gz
  $ cd smten-lib-4.0.0.0
  smten-lib-4.0.0.0$ cabal install
   ... (this may take a while ) ...

Hello, World
------------
Writing a Smten program is just like writing a Haskell program. The only
difference is the Smten libraries should be used instead of the standard
Haskell libraries.

The following is an implementation of a classic hello world program in
Smten:

--------------
  import Smten.Prelude
 
  main :: IO ()
  main = putStrLn "hello, world"
--------------

Create a file called 'hello.hs' which contains the hello world program. To
compile the program, run:

  $ smten --make -o hello hello.hs

This should produce an executable called +hello+, which you can now run:

  $ ./hello
  >>> hello, world

For more information on the +smten+ command and what arguments its accepts,
run:

  $ smten --help

Conclusion
----------
In this tutorial you wrote and ran your first Smten program. The
next tutorial demonstrates how to perform symbolic computation in Smten by
developing a solver for the +nqueens+ puzzle.
