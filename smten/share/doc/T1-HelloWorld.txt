Introduction
------------
This tutorial demonstrates how to write a and run a "hello, world" program in
Smten.

Hello World
-----------
The following code gives an implementation of the classic "hello, world"
program in Smten:

    module HelloWorld where

    main :: IO ()
    main = putStrLn "hello, world"

The syntax and features of Smten are (mostly) the same as the Haskell
language. For a better understanding of what these lines of code mean, consult
a Haskell tutorial.

To run this program, first create a file called HelloWorld.smtn which contains
this code. Smten programs must have the extension .smtn, and the filename
should match the module name.

Then run the commands:
    
    smten -f HelloWorld.smtn
    ghc -o helloworld -main-is Smten.Lib.HelloWorld.main__ Smten/Lib/HelloWorld.hs

The +smten+ command is used for compiling smten programs. The result of this
command is the generation of Haskell files corresponding to the Smten files
in the directory Smten/Lib. The +ghc+ command compiles the Haskell files into
an executable called helloworld which can then be run. To run the compiled
program:

   ./helloworld

You should see on the output the string "hello, world".
